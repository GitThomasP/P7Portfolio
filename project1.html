            InstAssist is the project we created during the first three weeks of the semester. The group was administratively created, 
            but ended up being group members who all had a bachelors degree in Interaction Design. During these three weeks, we developed the concept "InstAssist" 
            which is a tool used to support content creators. Specifically the tool assist the users finding "Instagramable"-locations nearby,
             based on their already existing content.

            <p class="lead">
              In the beginning of the project, we started out by discussing what urban scale meant, and examples of what it could be.
              Furthermore we brainstormed ideas of how AI could be implemented in these settings. A few of the ideas can be seen in the list to the right.

              <br> <br>
              Through further discussion we agreed that creating a solution for the best photo locations was the most interesting. 
              This was in part due to it feeling more unique than the rest of the ideas. <br>
              After having settled on an idea, we started researching different studies and research papers in regards to AI and related social media trends.

            <p class="lead">
              After having done some research, we came up with an initial concept that we could get feedback on in future interviews.
              This lead to us doing some interviews with influencers and people who generally post often on Instagram.
              This helped us grasp an understanding of their process of creating content; how they choose their location, what they spent the most time on etc.
              <br>
              The interviews were held online on teams, due to several of the participants living in Copenhagen, and they were found within a reasonably short amount of time. 
              <br> <br>
              And we found that several of them spent a lot of time researching a good location, and sometimes traveling far to reach that location to get a good picture. 
              <br>
              The findings from out interviews were translated into potential features for the app which then lead to us creating a storyboard of the idea, which can be seen to the left.
              This allowed us to visualise the goal of the app and get a coherrent understanding and agreement of the concept that we developed.
              <br> <br>
              We then used the last week of this project creating a prototype of the app using Figma. We used Figma as this was the tool the the majority of us was familiar with.

            <h2 class="display-4 fw-bold lh-1 text-body-emphasis InstAssist">InstAssist</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              The outcome of this projected ended up being an app called InstAssist.
              The app is a tool for people to use to get suggestions for good photo locations in the nearby radius.
              To use the app the users links it to their existing instagram account, where it will gather data about which type of content they create,
              and what their target audience is. This comes in the form of tags, that the AI generates on their profile. The tags are editable, meaning the user can add more or delete tags
              if they want to change it. 
              <br> <br>
              The locations that the app suggests are based around these tags, and also how much traction previous pictures from that location has gotten on Instagram. 
              The app also tracks current trends and suggests tags for the user, based around the current trends, allowing the user to see the trends potentially before it is trending in their country.  
              <br> <br>
              When the user chooses a location the app shows which tags it is trending under, and also it shows previously taken pictures from the location. 
              <br>
              This allows the user to both see what other people are doing to get ideas for their own poses or potentially what they should not do if want to be different. 
              <br> <br>
              Furthermore the app also shows the timeframe when it is the best to take pictures from the specific location.

            <p class="col-lg-8 mx-auto lead mb-0">
            As our group was purely people that all knew eachother from the bachelors it made it a bit easier to work together, as we had an idea of how eachother worked.
            However most of us have not had much experience working together, which we also had to get used to, to get a working group dynamic.
            <br> <br>
            However one problem was that for the duration of the three week project, one of the group members had to leave for vacation for of the three weeks.
            We tried to acommedate this, by having a meeting in the moring when they were available, however they did not have much time to participate.
            This led to some issues in regards to communication but also it meant that we for the most part was working with a person less although, they attemped to be as active as possible.
            <br> <br>
            Given that this was the first time that we ever had a three week project, we were not sure how much time we should spend on each part of the project.
            This lead to us settling on an idea quite fast, and not spending too much time brainstorming more ideas. If we had spend more time on developing each idea further
            we could have done some observations or more research into the individual ideas.
            <br> <br>
            This was also the issue we met when we did our interviews. We did not spend that much time finding participants for out interviews resulting in most of our participants living in other cities
             and one participant not being active on social media anymore. With more time spent we could have potentially found more relevant active influencers that we could interview in person.
            <br> <br>
            While these are some aspects where we could have benefitted from having spend more time, it also felt like a more productive start to the project, as usually we spend weeks coming up with a concept.
            This showed me that it can work quite well to spend less time on the ideation phase of the project.
