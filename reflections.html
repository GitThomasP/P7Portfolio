                Overall working on shorter projects was a great opportunity both for getting to know eachother better, 
                this includes the new people that have joined this semester.
                Also it was a great opportunity to experience how other people work, 
                that I had not previously had the chance to get to work with and also learn from them in regards to how they work.
                Especially those I did not know already from our bachelors degree.
                Furthermore it was a good experience to try and work in shorter timeframes, 
                and build on what I have previously learned from group work.
                Specifically it taught me more about how to navigate early ideation better, 
                as we did not have much time for this, but still ended up with quite good projects.
                Although I would still spend a bit more time on longer projects, to explore ideas more.

                <br> <br>
                I also benefitted from having to think about the concepts we were developing on different scales I.E. Room scale vs. Urban scale.
                These are not limitations we have previously had, we normally have had more vague general themes and a lot of freedom to adapt to it how we see fit.
                Now while it was a bit difficult at first, I did think our ideas were better for it, as it became more specific from the beginning.

                For the ten week project, I had the opportunity to make a research paper instead of the reports we are used to making. 
                This was great for showing me an alternative to the classic reports, even though I have had previous but limited experience with it.
                This format I might use in future projects.
