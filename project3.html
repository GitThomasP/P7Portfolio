            For the ten week project, we did not recieve a scale of which we should create a concept. But was still administratively created.
            Our group came up with the concept Fantasy Forge, which is a tool aiming to aid Dungeons and Dragons players in their character creation and gameplay, using AI.

            <p class="lead">
              Much like the previous projects we started out by discussing the different scales I.e. room scale and urban scale.
              We then tried to come up with some areas in which we could explore the use of AI. These ideas can be seen in the list to the right.
              <br> <br>
              From these ideas, we tried narrowing the list down by looking at already existing solutions but also interest.
              For example, several times throughout our bachelors degree, did a group make a tool to create recipes. So based on this it became less interesting to work with.
              From here we ended up choosing to work with Dungeons and Dragons.
              <br> <br>
              To grasp what we were working with, we decided to play a OneShot-campaign in Dungeons and Dragons, as two in the group had some prior experience, but the rest did not.
              <br> <br>
              Based on our own experience with this, we grasped that because Dungeons and Dragons is a very large and complex game, we needed to focus on a specific area. 
              This became the character creation initially, as we spent three hours creating characters ourselves, before we could even play the game.

            <p class="lead">
              To get a further understanding, we decided to interview some Dungeons and Dragons players.
              While this gave us insight into their experience playing the game, what they enjoy most about the game and which aspect they are passionate about.
              <br>
              It also highlighted some areas in which they felt the game could benefit from improving. This was partially the character creation, 
              but also the aspect of third party rulesets and custom monsters/spells.
              <br> <br>
              From here we came with an idea of AI generating characters, but we wanted to keep the tangible board game aspects, so we tried coming up with ideation cards, that could be used as NFC cards, 
              to create a tangible way of implementing the AI.
              <br> <br>
              To test wether the ideation cards could work, we decided to create a workshop with Dungeons and Dragons players, to test whether the idea worked.
              <br>
              This highlighted some areas which would need improvement. Specifically it at times became hard for the participants to identify the character they wanted to create with the amount of cards they had, 
              and the cards themselves did not always portray what they wanted it to.
              <br> <br>
              Following this workshop we started developing an app prototype, which should implement the AI, but also serve as a tool for the users, as there is a lot of information to keep track of in Dungeons and Dragons,
              we also wanted to assist in this matter.
              <br> <br>
              Following our development of our concept, we did a final real-case playtest with participants. We mainly here focused on how we could implement the AI into the game, and the aspect of character creation.
              While we largely diminished the time taken to create characters, we also met a few issues here. The AI did not always do what the participants expected, based on the cards they had.
              And also the cards themselves did not feel like they were part of the game, but more so an addition to the game. Which ultimately meant that our concept was not a direct solution to our problem, but still seemed to be able to serve as a tool, 
              although we would have to figure out how to or if we should even add the cards to it.

            <p class="lead">
              At the end of the project we had a prototype of our concept, Fantasy Forge. While the physical aspects of the game are still very important to players,
              which is something that we did not want to diminish. We therefore decided to make an app instead of a website, as it would be less intrusive.
              <br> <br>
              It does this by mostly replacing the character sheets from Dungeons and Dragons and provides opportunity for AI to help you generate charaters, spells or items.
              As seen on the illustration to the right, each field has an option to get locked, which means that if the player inputs something in the feild, it will be locked to preserve the players choice.
              Also if the player does not like what the output from the AI is, it can get re-generated.
              <br> <br>
              The players can also see their party in the app, to see their health, level etc. This provides the player with more information, that the traditional character sheets do not.

            <p class="col-lg-8 mx-auto lead mb-0">
              Our composition consisted of three members from our bachelors degree, one person who came from a former year of interaction design and one person who had a bachelors degree in software engineering.
              Because of this we did have to adap to eachother and learn how eachother worked. Although it also did not hinder the progress very much, as they came from different backgrounds they were quite open, and we quickly got used to eachother.
              <br> <br>
              Due to the previous three week projects, I do think we settled on an idea quite quickly, which I think was a good situation that I do not think would have happened, had we not had the previous two projects.
              Although the subject that we chose was very large and very complex, which was a big hurdle we had to navigate. I do not believe most of us knew how complicated the game actually was before we began working with it.
              <br> <br>
              One thing that might have been a hinderence was that throughout the project, our approach did not always feel targeted enough, causing us to explore some areas too much. 
              One example might be that we did not begin working on our app prototype until much later in the project, that I previously have been used to, which meant that we could not ideate further on our concept, although we did
              get the opportunity to explore the area of the NFC ideation cards more, and the tangible interactions it could bring into the game.
              <br> <br>
              In this project we also did more evaluations that I normally have done in semester projects. I have been used to a total of two evaluations, while this project we did three in total with the interviews.
              I think that this was time well spend, on exploring what we could do with AI, but I do think it also hindered our ability to develop a prototype.
              <br> <br>
              Something else that we experienced, was in the group we had some absence, a lot due to illness, but also for myself having to stay home due to moving address. 
              This could also have impacted the progress of our project a bit. Although the group work generally worked quite well.
              <br> <br>
              If we had more time I do believe it would be interesting to explore our app concept further, and do evaluations more based on the app, as our last evaluation did not test the app that much, the participants mostly got to see the concept of it.
